# GOAT*-tracker

## A simple site that will display values scraped from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ that will show how far LeBron James from surpassing the next player above him on all-time rankings and, assuming the current season's per game output, site will also display projected number of games he will need to surpass the player next in line. Site will show, in particular, points, assists, and Win Shares.

## This is a fun project that will allow me to dip back into BeautifulSoup

### Though a native New Englander and Celtics fan I've long enjoyed and marveled at Mr. James' consistency and excellence. Now that he is in the later stages of his career I am keeping track of the incredible cumulative statistics.
